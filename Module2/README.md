# Module 2: Cryptographic Reduction

## How to get task descriptions and instructions

This module is split into 8 tasks. The recommended order of attempting them is as follows:
1. Schnorr NMA + Schnorr CMA
2. KatzWang NMA + KatzWang CMA
3. DLog to CDH
4. CDH to Quadratic
5. DHI to DY05
6. RSA PKCS#1

The order is suggested based on difficulty and task relations. Feel free to finish them in any order that you like.

To get specific instructions on each task, look into the folder `task_descriptions`. Note that these descriptions are pretty vague and one could easily get lost within the complicated terms. Moreover, these cryptographic reductions are works of researchers that potentially could take years of studies; some even require sophisticated mathematical tools including but not limited to group theory, number theory, algebra, etc. Hence, it would be challenging to come up with a proof/reduction all by yourself, especially taking into account the limited time you are given to solve these tasks. Therefore, to help you with getting ideas and inspirations, I found some papers that are related to these topics. These papers are listed within folder `related_papers`. Not all tasks come with a paper, but they should help you overcome the toughest ones.

## How to run and test your code
The code that are attached here may not be sufficient for the tests to function. One may want to use CodeExpert for testing their code. For the Bleichenbacher task, CodeExpert does not support the huge number of queries and one need to run on a local machine. Code are sufficient for running this task.
