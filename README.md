# information_security_lab

This is a repo of course projects at ETH Zurich. The course is called Information Security Lab, where you will be exposed to all kinds of security related concerns including encription, stack overflow, information transfer protocals.

Owing to the diverse nature of the course, you will be exposed to all kinds of languages including Python, C++, Java, Go, etc. The process of familiarizing yourself with these languages might be painful and you may not know where to start.

This repo aims to help you with acquainting yourselves with the basic usages of the different functions in different languages.
